<h1>The Current State of AI</h1>
<p>There is a big gap between what AI researchers at top labs believe
and what the general public believes, i.e. a big gap in “situational
awareness”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2025/26, these machines will outpace college graduates. By the end
of the decade, they will be smarter than you or I [sic]…</p>
<p>Everyone is now talking about AI, but few have the faintest glimmer
of what is about to hit them. Nvidia analysts still think 2024 might be
close to the peak. Mainstream pundits are stuck on the willful blindness
of “it’s just predicitng the next word”</p>
<p>Before long, the world will wake up. But right now, there are perhaps
a few hundred people, most of them in San Francisco and AI labs, that
have <em>situational awareness</em>…. [they] correctly predict[ed] the
AI advances of the past few years. Whether these people are also right
about the next few years remains to be seen. But these are very smart
people – the smartest people I have ever met – and they are the ones
building the technology…. If they are seeing the future even close to
correctly, we are in for a wild ride.</p>
<p><em>Leopold Aschenbrenner, Former OpenAI researcher, June
2024</em></p>

<h1>What do AI Labs Think</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know exactly when it’ll come, I don’t know if it’ll be 2027.
I think it’s plausible it could be longer than that. I don’t think it
will be a whole bunch longer than that when AI systems are better than
humans at almost everything. Better than almost all humans at almost
everything. And then eventually better than all humans at everything,
even robotics.</p>

<h1>What do AI Labs Think</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have
traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the
first AI agents “join the workforce” and materially change the output of
companies…. We are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to
superintelligence in the true sense of the word.</p>

not ill, nor am I becoming a stay-at-home mom, nor have I been so
financially fortunate to be on the brink of voluntary retirement. I

should it arrive, to end employment as I know it.</p>

Bengio</a>: “…while we are racing towards AGI or even ASI, nobody
currently knows how such an AGI or ASI could be made to behave morally,
or at least behave as intended by its developers and not turn against
humans.. As of now, however, we are racing towards a world with entities
that are smarter than humans and pursue their own goals – without a
reliable method for humans to ensure those goals are compatible with
human goals.”</li>
